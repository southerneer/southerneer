<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16" title="Code Complete" src="assets/CodeComplete2.jpg" alt="Code Complete book cover" width="410" height="500" />As a journeyman software engineer I'm always seeking to learn more about my craft. It makes my job more interesting, it helps me get work done faster, and (in theory) justifies a higher salary. In the course of a normal work day I learn random things by Googling for solutions to specific problems, but I rarely step back to look at the entirety of a project.</p>
<p>My New Year's Resolution this year is to spend time every day learning something new about software development. To that end, I'm slowly working my way through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327373250&amp;sr=8-1">Code Complete</a>, a book often cited by co-founder of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> Jeff Atwood.</p>
<p>The book could just as aptly be called Managing Complexity because all of the techniques and practices always come back to this one tenet. When you think about it, the point of writing software is to create a series of instructions for a computer to execute. Computers today are amazingly fast and powerful and getting more so everyday. They are capable of executing millions of operations every second. And while it would be <em>possible</em>Â to write one big code file with millions of lines describing a program, it would be nearly <em>impossible</em> for another developer to understand or debug. It should therefore be every developer's goal to manage complexity by breaking down programs into intelligible, coherent, "bite size" chunks that make sense individually but taken together make a complex program. Likewise, large software projects spanning multiple teams of developers and months or even years of time need to get broken down to form realistic goals and expectations.</p>
