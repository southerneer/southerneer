<p>I haven't had much luck with the ladies lately. There are numerous reasons why, but I'll leave that for another post. For now, suffice it to say that I'm struggling to find a girl worth dating dating. Nevertheless, I persist and spend an inordinate amount of time and energy scheming ways of getting women and I'm always looking for new strategies. Going to bars is a sure way of putting myself in close proximity to women, but it can also be frustrating to weed out the crazy, engaged/married, unattractive, and stupid girls while dozens of other dudes are circling and the music is blaring.</p>
<p>Enter match.com. Impersonal? Maybe. Creepy? A bit. Efficient? Definitely. I can thoroughly scour a girl's picture and profile in about 5 minutes and get a pretty decent sense of what she brings to the table. After a few months of match I've started to notice some trends. 90% of women's profiles fit neatly into a few very specific categories. I submit for your entertainment:</p>
<p><strong>The Loner </strong>(mirror pics exclusively)</p>
<p><strong>Pet Personality </strong>(substitute pet for personality)</p>
<p><strong>Plain Jane</strong>Â (uninteresting blah profile, boilerplate)</p>
