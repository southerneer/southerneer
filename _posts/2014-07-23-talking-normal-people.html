<p>I'm an engineer by profession. And for better or worse, I'm an engineer by train of thought. In particular, I have a very specific notion of "truth" and "correct". I don't like to claim that I know how something works without having tested it myself or at least having it explained thoroughly by someone who has.</p>
<p>Let's say I'm working on a web page and I need to add a button to pop up a message to the user. Simple. This is a common piece of functionality that I've implemented a million times previously and I could write that code in my sleep. But if I were to do it right now I would still test it. I would have to. Because if you're a software engineer and you don't test your work then your work will suck. I prefer that my work not suck so I make sure that every little thing functions correctly before moving on.</p>
<p>This kind of thinking isn't exclusive to engineers, but the nature of the job (always building stuff) and the consequences for the simplest of mistakes (a misplaced semi-colon or an off-by-one math error) combined with the innate tendencies of folks who are drawn to a life of messing with 1s and 0s make for peculiar and somewhat obsessive personalities.</p>
<p>What am I getting at? Well, this kind of "precise" thinking inevitably bleeds over into completely unrelated aspects of life...like everyday conversations. If I realize that someone is telling me something that is technically incorrect it is reeeeally hard to resist correcting them. It's the "<a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2011/Feb-17.html">well actually</a>" phenomenon.</p>
<p>Person: "You're feeling sick? You should drink this MegaVitaGreenJuice blend. It's got so much vitamin C that it's bound to help!"<br />
Me: "Well actually, your body can only absorb so much vitamin C and the extra 400% of the daily allowance in that drink will just get flushed out the next time I take a piss."<br />
Person: "..."<br />
Me: "I'm just sayin...but thanks for the tip and the general good vibes! I swear I'm not a dick!"</p>
<p>This deep-rooted impulse to correct even the most innocuous and well meaning assertions almost invariably makes me sound like a prick. And because I realize this in the moment as I'm well-actually-ing some poor soul, I hesitate and try to soften the correction thus making it sound even <em>more</em> condescending. It's a vicious problem.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about this a lot these days because I don't hang out with many (any?) engineer thinkers on a regular basis. I can't get my daily allotment of truth speaking out of the way and it boils over into conversation with "normal people". Let this post be an open apology to those people...I'm sorry and I'm working on it.</p>
