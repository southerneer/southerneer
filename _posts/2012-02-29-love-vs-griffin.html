<p>Hmmm...I guess there are two questions rolled in one here. A) Who is the better player? and B) What are the traits you look for in an individual player when you're "building a team around" them.</p>
<p>For the sake of argument, let's just say they're equivalent defenders.</p>
<p>Right now, Love is better offensively. Period. The killer arguments for him are his superior passing and shooting. He benefits greatly from a smart point guard like Rubio setting the table for him on pick-and-pops, but he doesn't fit the standard superstar mold of a guy who can create his own shot. As JLos mentioned he might be able to parlay his shooting skills into a Dirk-like offensive game, but I don't ever see him moving like that.</p>
