<p>For those of you not from the South (Tennessee, Virginia, NC, and SC in particular), Cookout is a delicious fast food restaurant that is also super cheap. They serve 50 different milk shake flavors. They have BBQ sandwiches. If you thought McDonald's yielded the maximum calories/dollars ratio then think again. You can get a Cookout Tray for $4.39 which might include a Double Burger, a giant iced tea, and 2 corn dogs...because corn dogs are side items. The nutrition facts are <a href="http://www.cookoutnc.com/index.php?action=nutrition">still pending</a>, but I think you can do the math. It's fast, it's cheap, and it's tasty.</p>
<p>Apart from some unusual food choices, Cookout sets itself apart from its competition by not having indoor seating. Some don't even have outdoor seating, just a walk-up window and two parallel drive-thru lanes. Which means that the entire structure of the restaurant is devoted to cooking food. And since every Cookout I've ever seen is surrounded by either reflective or tinted glass, you can't actually <em>see</em> where the food is being prepared.</p>
<p>This brings me to the original point of this post. Being a software developer I noted that each Cookout restaurant is a perfect "black box". It abstracts away the notion of preparing food. All the customer knows is that they feed input to the cashier (the order and the money) and after a short delay the cashier delivers output (food, drink, and a receipt). Judging by the smoke rolling out of the chimney I would assume that inside there's a giant grill inside manned by a cook furiously flipping burgers. But maybe there's just the end of a tube connected to a central food factory in China. Or a magical burger genie who conjures fully cooked chicken nuggets out of thin air. Or Emeril Lagasse barking orders to his white-apron-clad underlings to finish up the latest order.</p>
<p>It doesn't really matter <em>how</em> my input yields the correct output. I don't need to know how the meal was prepared (and in fact I probably don't want to know). Similarly, a well-written class will expose only the properties and methods required to fulfill its purpose while hiding away the details. Newbie developers can take a lesson from Cookout: keep the inner workings of your class behind reflective glass. We don't want to know how the sausage is made.</p>
