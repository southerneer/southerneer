<p style="text-align: left;">I've been in Korea for a little over 5 months now and I'm constantly struggling to reconcile the differences between Korea and America. Some things about Korea make me wish I was back home, but there are also many other things that Korea does really well. One of these is transportation. The subway is efficient, ubiquitous, and cheap -- for less than 2 dollars you could make a full circuit of this one of the largest cities on Earth. If you're out too late (or early as it were) you can always flag down one of the many city cabs which are also very cheap. 20 bucks gets you from one far end to the other.</p>
