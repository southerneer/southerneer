<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For better or worse, my current job requires at least a cursory knowledge of how to set up and run Facebook Ads. This is true for many other people's jobs. The ad platform is constantly changing and often broken to some extent. New bugs arise and the documentation is constantly outdated and behind the changes. Facebook makes a lot of money off of these ads but they're under constant pressure to improve the ads platform (to make more money to satisfy investors). The platform is just a chunk of software (albeit massive) which means it can change as fast as Facebook's engineers can crank out new code and the documentation is always a few iterations behind. Being a developer I understand that it's a tough problem to solve but Facebook has the resources to do this way better. Step up your game, dawg.</p>
<p>&lt;/Rant&gt;</p>
<p>All this is to say that the Facebook Ad platform is a moving target with constantly outdated documentation. Blogs (like this one) are the best way to keep abreast of the ever-changing landscape so as not to get completely lost and confused. To that end I'm posting my theory on this strange message I saw in Facebook Power Editor...</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1321" src="assets/Screen-Shot-2014-07-09-at-11.33.35-AM.png" alt="Power editor screenshot" width="497" height="112" /></p>
<p>As of this writing, there's nothing in the documentation to explain this bewildering message. A quick Google search of the phrase "currently active and you cannot deactivate it" reveals...nothing. My theory is that since my ad is under review it is in a limbo state and no changes can be made to it. Once it's been approved I can deactivate or make any number of other changes. Or it will get rejected and get deactivated. Either way I have to wait and hypothesize. Hopefully this post (and subsequent comments ;) ) will shed some light on this small mystery.</p>
