    <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26" title="Kobe riding pine" src="/assets/kobe.jpg" alt="Poor Kobe" width="640" height="426" /></p>
<p>I love basketball. It was always my favorite sport to play and it's one of the few sports I can watch without quickly getting bored. As a born North Carolinian I was introduced to the thrill of the college game at a very early age. This mania was only furthered by 4 years at UNC-Chapel Hill the last of which coincided with Roy Williams' first NCAA championship in '05 (Ray Felton, Sean May, Rashad McCants, Marvin Williams, and company). I now live in downtown Charlotte a stone's throw from the the Charlotte Bobcats home court. And while the Bobcats are in the midst of their worst season, their opponents will generally provide a decent show. For example, I had the pleasure of watching Blake Griffin dunk all over the woeful Cat a couple of Saturdays ago and I reveled in every minute of it.</p>
<p>My mania for basketball is not confined to the four corners of the court. Watching the games are the best part, but I also enjoy breakdowns of offensive and defensive sets and learning <em>why</em> one team or player is better than another. But for some reason I never participated in a fantasy basketball league until last year. I think I had convinced myself that it was a time waster and I had better things to do. Only half of that last sentence is true. When my friend Grant created a league and invited all my college buddies I figured it would be a good chance to stay in touch since many of them had spread across the globe pursuing careers, dreams, and/or women.</p>
<p>I was immediately hooked. My morning routine during ball season consisted of perusing stats and articles and listening to basketball podcasts. I would refine my watch list and check the injury report and upcoming schedule searching for any slight advantage. By season's end I may have known more about Jerryd Bayless than anyone outside of his immediate family.</p>
<p>I really like <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/frontpage/basketball">ESPN's implementation</a> of Fantasy Basketball but when I read <a href="http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7380292/the-12th-day-nba-christmas">this Grantland article</a> by Bill Simmons I was excited to try it out. In a nutshell, he describes a league that closer simulates the business side of the NBA by factoring in players' salaries and enforcing a salary cap. So instead of just drafting the best players you can get, you have to go one level deeper and draft for <em>value</em>. For example, Kobe Bryant is a prolific scorer but wouldn't have much value in the scheme of this league because he makes $25M/year. Contrast him with a player like Stephen Curry who also scores in buckets but would only cost an owner a shade over $3M this year. So while Curry doesn't stuff the stat sheet quite as well as Kobe, he wouldn't suck up a huge chunk of a team's $58M salary cap either.</p>
<p>Obviously this scheme isn't for everybody...which is why it doesn't exist on any popular websites yet. I've been thinking about writing it myself for a while, but I couldn't find any convenient way of pulling all the player and game stats until I stumbled on to the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/fantasysports/guide/index.html">Yahoo Fantasy API</a>. Now I can leverage Yahoo's basketball statistics database to write my own version of a fantasy basketball league based on the Bill Simmons premise. <a href="http://api.ning.com/files/urcOx8-1tHS0PBZD9ynfcgkSbd8hU2vhPs8yomb-lt46CRT3Ma4my*sQ0ieU8XmbcAUJv35nBQOAFFmkQbbyzsYjrqaRgtE7/Linsanity_Jeremy_Lin_Knicks.png?width=650&amp;height=394">Linsane</a>!</p>
