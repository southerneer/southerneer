<p><a title="Fireside chats" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireside_chats">My friends</a>,<br />
If you didn't already know, I'm moving to South Korea! I'll be shipping out on September 21st with <a title="Whitney Wins!" href="http://whitneywins.wordpress.com/">my lady</a> and we'll be gone for at least a year. Whitney will be teaching Engrish to little Korean children in <a title="Incheon" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incheon">Incheon</a> and I'll be working with my old buddy Clay.</p>
<p>This move promises to be many things...</p>
<h3>A Bummer</h3>
<p>...because I'll no longer get to jam out with <a title="Trial by Fire" href="http://www.trialbyfirejourney.net/">Trial by Fire</a> or <a title="5 on Sundays" href="http://www.fiveonsundays.com/">5 on Sundays</a>. This past year has been an amazing time when I've gotten to play drums in both of these bands. In TBF, I had the challenge of meshing with a well-established group and learning all the ins and outs of playing a live show. After just one month of small weekend gigs I was playing on the big stage at <a title="The Fillmore Charlotte" href="http://fillmorecharlottenc.com/">The Fillmore</a> in front of a thousand people! In 5OS, I participated in the start of a brand new band that is rapidly gaining recognition in the Charlotte live music scene. We started practicing in earnest in January of this year and we've already played 5 shows in front of hundreds of people! I've made lifelong friends in my bandmates from each group and I'll really miss the experience of playing with them.</p>
<p>I'll also be leaving my friends and family in the Charlotte area. I won't be able to grab lunch with the uptown working folks anymore. No more Wednesday basketball at Charlotte Prep. No more haircut clubs. No more Bobcats/Hornets games. No more grilling on the patio. Sad face.</p>
<h3>A Challenge</h3>
<p>...because my world will be changing entirely. I'm taking on a new and exciting role with Clay's startup company, <a title="Redwood" href="http://redwood-inc.com/?page_id=17&amp;lang=en">Redwood</a>. I'll have to learn the language. I'll have to figure out how to get around in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_urban_areas_by_population">one of the largest cities in the world</a>. I'll have to cope with a culture that thinks "barbecue" means <a href="http://www.southerneer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/kbarbecue.jpg">this</a> instead of <a href="http://www.southerneer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/barbecue.jpg">this</a> and has never even heard of <a href="http://www.southerneer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/sweet-tea.jpg">this</a>. Apprehensive face.</p>
<h3>Awesome</h3>
<p>...because I get to live out a lifelong dream! I never studied abroad in college and while I've traveled all over the US and even to different countries I've never <em>lived</em> in a foreign country. There's always been a good excuse to not do it, but as I approach 30 years on this earth it's become clear that I need to shit or get off the pot. And who better to shit with than my lovely girlfriend Whitney?! (phrasing could use a little work there, but you get the gist).</p>
<h3>Are you gone forever?</h3>
<p>Nope, just a year initially. In fact, Whitney and I will both be forced to leave Korea after a year because our work visas will expire. And while we'll physically be on the other side of the world we'll still be easily reachable. There's always email, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/the.eric.kirkham">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/jerkham">Twitter</a>. And I have a permanent phone number thanks to Google Voice. And Whitney and I will (hopefully) be composing some video messages of our new experiences in Korea. It's only a year and it'll fly by before you know it, but in the meantime I'll miss my friends and family back home dearly.</p>
<p>One really good way of alleviating the pain of parting: come visit us! We won't have a ton of room (I'll be rooming with Clay and Whitney will be cozied up in a studio apartment) but if you can stomach the airfare and sleeping on a couch then we will show you an amazing time in South Korea where the food is tasty and cheap, the beer is plentiful, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soju">soju</a> even more plentiful, the people <em>adore</em> Americans, and <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/12/strict-gun-control-laws-in-south-korea/">you won't get shot</a>!</p>
