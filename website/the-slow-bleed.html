  <article class="post-content">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever I go out to eat with friends I like to play a game called Credit Card Roulette. The rules are pretty simple: when it's time to pay the bill each person throws a credit card into a hat, a server shuffles them up and draws one card at a time, last card drawn pays the whole bill. It's fun, it spices things up a bit, and it's way simpler than splitting up the bill and dealing with cash and multiple credit cards.</p>
<p>For a person hearing about the rules for the first time there are two possible reactions. "Sweet! I have a good chance of getting a free meal!" OR "Whoa, I just can't stomach the idea of paying the whole bill". Both are natural first impressions. If it's a large bill or your checking account is a little light then this game probably doesn't make sense to play. But assuming you have a comfortable bankroll then the risk vs. reward is perfectly balanced...meaning that if you play enough times you'll end up with the same financial hit as if you just paid each bill individually.</p>
<p>What's fascinating is the psychology of the pain of loss vs. the pleasure of winning. Credit card roulette is a game of many small wins and a few big losses. If you disregard the math and statistics and concentrate on the <em>feeling</em> of any particular outcome then you might conclude that the wins are relatively insignificant compared to the massive pain of having to pay the table's tab. Even after explaining the statistics and how over the long run you end up paying the same, many people can't get past the concept of that big number.</p>
<p>Now let's flip focus to a different game: the lottery. I'll assume that you know the rules of a lottery and just point out that in contrast to Credit Card Roulette, the psychology of a lottery is flip-flopped. Over the long run a person will experience many small losses (buying a lottery ticket) vs very few (if any) very large gains (winning the lottery). In strictly statistical terms, all for-profit lotteries (i.e. all state lotteries) are not risk-reward balanced. In other words, you'll end up paying more than you win back in the long run. But even after explaining that statistical fact it can be hard to disregard the psychological impact of that big win...</p>
<p>I like to think of this psychological phenomenon as the Slow Bleed. People are more likely to feel comfortable with small pains with an eye toward a big payout as opposed to gaining a few small payments at a time with a few large losses. I don't have any statistics or studies to back up this intuition, but I think that more people favor the former over the latter...even if statistics would dictate otherwise.</p>
