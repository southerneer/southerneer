<p>Wordpress is a fine tool for creating blog-based websites. It is a mature and popular platform which has the nice side benefit of lots of theme choices. Some themes have "sophisticated" configuration options that make it relatively easy for the average website user to customize the look and feel of the site. Just click a few buttons and slide a few sliders and you can make some pretty cool changes to a base theme. The nasty side of all these clever options is that they add a lot of overhead to the site's download footprint. I have had the unpleasant experience of my coworkers using these themes to get 95% of what they want in a website design and asking me to tweak the code to get the last 5% of what they want. This creates a huge headache.</p>
