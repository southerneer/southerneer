What's a "Southerneer"? That's a combination of "southerner" and "engineer". You see, I was born and raised in North Carolina and I fiddle with websites and technology from time to time.

What can I do for you? Anything web-related is right in my wheelhouse. Got an idea for a website but need help making it a reality? I'm on it. Got a site already but it sucks. I understand, I've seen it a million times before, and I can help. Looking to take an existing site to the next level? I can help you think through that process, advise on best practices and technologies, and execute on that plan.

I'm a big fan of the web and the way it empowers anyone and everyone to communicate with the rest of the world. I'm also a nerd so I love digging into the nuts and bolts of how that all works and why. I'm constantly learning new techniques, languages, platforms and I'm mostly technology-agnostic, but these are some of my core competencies:

**Front-end**

* HTML
* Javascript
* CSS


**Backend**

* PHP
* MySQL


**Frameworks**

* Wordpress
* CodeIgniter


**Hosting/service platforms**

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Microsoft Azure


**A few things I'm learning and working into my toolbelt (or just playing around with)**

* Node
* Ruby on Rails
* Kinect v2
