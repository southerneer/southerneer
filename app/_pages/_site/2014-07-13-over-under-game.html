<h1>FAQ<a name="faq"></a></h1>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the Over/Under Game?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-under">over-under</a> is a type of bet. The Over/Under Game isn't about money though. It's about putting a number to a prediction and putting it out there for your friends to think about.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can you give me an example?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> Yep, something like... "Over/Under 48.5 wins for the Hornets in the '14/'15 season." If you take the under then you're betting that the Hornets will win 48 or fewer games. If you take the over then you're betting that they'll win 49 or more. Pretty simple.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why the extra .5?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> The ideal Over/Under avoids a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_betting#Spreads_in_sports_wagering">push</a>" -- a situation where someone guesses the O/U exactly on the predicted number. In the example above, if the over/under was set at 48 games and the Hornets won exactly 48 games then the result would be considered a push.  The most entertaining O/U games set an "unpushable" target that forces you to think hard and take one side or the other.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the Pick Deadline?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> The Pick Deadline is there for you to set a date and time after which your O/U won't accept anymore picks. In the Hornets example above, it would probably be a good idea to set a Pick Deadline for the first day of the NBA season so that people won't be able to game your prediction.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What about Game End Date?<br />
<strong>A:</strong> The Game End Date is when your Over/Under finishes and the winning side (over or under) can be determined. Continuing with the Hornets example, you could set the Game End Date for the day after the last Hornets regular season game.</p>
