<p>What's a "Southerneer"? That's a combination of "southerner" and "engineer". You see, I was born and raised in North Carolina and I fiddle with websites and technology from time to time.</p>
<p>What can I do for you? Anything web-related is right in my wheelhouse. Got an idea for a website but need help making it a reality? I'm on it. Got a site already but it sucks. I understand, I've seen it a million times before, and I can help. Looking to take an existing site to the next level? I can help you think through that process, advise on best practices and technologies, and execute on that plan.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of the web and the way it empowers anyone and everyone to communicate with the rest of the world. I'm also a nerd so I love digging into the nuts and bolts of how that all works and why. I'm constantly learning new techniques, languages, platforms and I'm mostly technology-agnostic, but these are some of my core competencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Front-end
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>CSS</li>

<li>Ruby on Rails</li>

</ul>
