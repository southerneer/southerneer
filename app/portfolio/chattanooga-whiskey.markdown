This website already existed and they just needed a refresh. Generally I try to avoid inherited code without some serious forethought, but this is one of the few cases where I was impressed with the state of the codebase when I took a look under the hood. Bobby Burden at [Delegator](https://www.delegator.com) built a first-class site with modular plugins that was actually a joy to look through and I even learned a few things from their code. With the help of some sweet designs from Rich Abercrombie at Chattanooga Whiskey I was able to lay in a new look and feel on the site. I also helped implement a ticketing system using Eventbrite for tours at their new distillery in Southside Chattanooga.
