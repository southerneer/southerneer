Chattanooga Whiskey, still in its infancy as a brand, had an existing website but it needed updating design-wise as well as some new functionality to support the opening of their brand new stillhouse in downtown Chattanooga.
With the help of some sweet designs from Rich Abercrombie I was able to lay in a new look and feel on the site. I also helped implement an online ticketing system using Eventbrite for tours at the new distillery location.
