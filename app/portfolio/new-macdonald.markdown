**Technology stack**: [ScrollMagic](http://scrollmagic.io/), PHP, Elastic Beanstalk

This project came in hot just as we were hitting crunch time with the [KIA Chicago Auto Show project](/kia-cas/). It was really fun working with ScrollMagic to create user-controlled animations as they scrolled down the page, but this project was a blur dev-wise and I didn't really get to spend much time tweaking it and making everything smooth. One of these I really want to try another project and add in some really nice animations to bring it to life.
