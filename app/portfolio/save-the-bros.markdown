Organic Valley was coming out with a product, a protein shake, that was entering a crowded space. They needed a way to cut through the clutter and announce their product to the world in a unique way. That's where Humanaut stepped in and came up with the concept of "Save the Bros". It was a really fun concept and I was glad to be on board to help bring it to life. Over the course of about a month we built out a microsite with an "Instafeed" (mashup of related Instagram posts) section full of brotastic photos, a [full-page background video](http://dfcb.github.io/BigVideo.js/), and a slick user-friendly sign-up form. I chose to deploy the site on [Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) so that in the event of major "virality" with crazy traffic peaks the site would scale seamlessly and never go down.

The site was a huge success, [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewBG_jmMI40_) was great, we got tons of good press, and the client came back for more with [The Brononymous Hotline](/brononymous/) a few months later. Boom!
