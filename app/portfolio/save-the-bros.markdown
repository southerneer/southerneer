**Partners**: Redwood, Humanaut

**Client**: [Organic Valley](http://www.organicvalley.coop/)

**Technology stack**: PHP, [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Bower](http://bower.io/), Codekit, LESS, Elastic Beanstalk

At its most basic, this was a microsite where users could learn about a new product (Organic Fuel) and get a coupon. That's boring as hell. But that's where Humanaut stepped in and came up with the concept of Save the Bros. It was a great (and fun) idea and I was glad to be on board to help bring it to life. Over the course of about a month we built out a microsite with an Instafeed section full of brotastic photos, a [full-page background video](http://dfcb.github.io/BigVideo.js/), and a slick user-friendly sign-up form. I chose to deploy on [Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) so that in the event of major "virality" with crazy traffic peaks the site would scale seamlessly and never go down.

The site was a huge success, [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewBG_jmMI40_) was great, we got tons of good press, and the client came back for more with [The Brononymous Hotline](/brononymous/) a few months later. Boom!
