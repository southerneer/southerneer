**Client**: [Fancy Rhino](http://fancyrhino.com)

**Technology stack**: PHP, Wordpress, [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/), [Sage](https://roots.io/sage/), [Beaver Builder](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/), [CMB2](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2), [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), [Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com/)

This was a mammoth project for a newbie independent developer like me. Drew Belz, one of the founders at [Fancy Rhino](http://fancyrhino.com) was already working with a nice-looking site/blog based on a Django backend that was only a couple years old, but it was just unwieldy enough that nobody at the company ever created new content for it. They wanted a Wordpress site with a nicer backend interface that they could control and make beautiful posts, case studies, and stories with. Plus they were some of my best friends in Chattanooga so it seemed like a win/win...I get to work with people I like and respect and make a little money at the same time. Drew and I first talked over the basic idea of the site while we were working together in Chicago on the [Kia Auto Show project](/kia-cas/) back in February and got down to brass tacks with a first draft of the design/UI toward the end of April.

It was an ambitious site design from the outset: a fully customized Wordpress implementation with infinite scrolling cards based on a ["masonry" layout](http://masonry.desandro.com/). The posts themselves would be highly customizable from a design perspective. Lots of stuff. I think I initially estimated out about 6 weeks of work. This stretched out to over 4 months of most of my efforts devoted to this site. To be fair there was about a week of downtime when I drove cross-country to California and another couple weeks where I was more focused on the Brononymous Hotline, but even still this project ended up being a lot bigger than I had anticipated...and it was all my fault.

I'm pretty lazy when it comes to thinking through development projects. [Most developers are](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/648/how-to-respond-when-you-are-asked-for-an-estimate). We just want to jump in and start hacking. Also, I had done Wordpress work before, but never truly dug into the guts of writing my own theme, plugins, widgets, custom hooks, etc. I didn't know what I didn't know. It would have taken a couple weeks of learning more about the Wordpress development environment to even begin coming up with a reliable estimate. I was naive. Thankfully Drew and the rest of the Fancy peeps were patient and always willing to work with me. Hats off to them.
