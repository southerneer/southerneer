<p>I've played drums since middle school but I'd never taken it seriously until about a year ago. I did marching band through 10th grade and my parents bought me a beginner-level drumkit that I pounded on every once in a while. When I went off to college at UNC I couldn't easily bring the set with me into my dorm room...at least not at first. My kit actually lived in a buddy's dorm room during my senior year and I would go by to jam occasionally but that was still pretty far from "serious".</p>
<p>After college my drum set would always make the move with me from rental houses in Chapel Hill (<a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=bolinwood+Drive,+Chapel+Hill,+NC&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=35.925257,-79.050603&amp;spn=0.001696,0.002486&amp;sll=35.916738,-79.037243&amp;sspn=0.006786,0.009946&amp;hnear=Bolinwood+Dr,+Chapel+Hill,+Orange,+North+Carolina+27514&amp;t=m&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=35.925344,-79.050541&amp;panoid=o9UKVKY2MJPhpo8E-bpiKw&amp;cbp=13,252.33,,0,22.76">Bolinwood</a>, <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=125+Glendale+Drive,+Chapel+Hill,+NC&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=35.916469,-79.036632&amp;spn=0.006751,0.009946&amp;sll=35.916992,-79.037273&amp;layer=c&amp;cbp=13,334.73,,0,-0.02&amp;cbll=35.916739,-79.037246&amp;hnear=125+Glendale+Dr,+Chapel+Hill,+Orange,+North+Carolina+27514&amp;t=m&amp;z=17&amp;panoid=L3da-l6yX9jozVhD_hplKw">Glendale</a>) to Raleigh (<a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Kaplan+Drive,+Raleigh,+NC&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=35.774348,-78.711446&amp;spn=0.001691,0.002486&amp;sll=35.925344,-79.050542&amp;sspn=0.001696,0.002486&amp;oq=kaplan+Drive,+&amp;hnear=Kaplan+Dr,+Raleigh,+Wake,+North+Carolina+27606&amp;t=m&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=35.774263,-78.711495&amp;panoid=6GMwcP5yj4sMRGESo1Uepg&amp;cbp=13,99.78,,0,2.87">Kaplan</a>, <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Raleigh,+NC&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=35.805609,-78.645327&amp;spn=0.00169,0.002486&amp;sll=35.774263,-78.711494&amp;sspn=0.0017,0.002486&amp;hnear=Raleigh,+Wake,+North+Carolina&amp;t=m&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=35.805685,-78.64527&amp;panoid=3a94Vzl6u21m5RG1BLAbXg&amp;cbp=13,96.64,,0,3.62">White Oak)</a> annoying many a roommate along the way. When I finally migrated back to Charlotte I started jamming with my friend Jason Rome. He introduced me to other musicians in the area and we would get together every couple of weeks to jam. I still wasn't practicing on a regular basis at this point, but the interaction with other musicians definitely heightened my interest in improving and growing as a drummer.</p>
<p>Last year (2012), Jason joined <a href="http://www.trialbyfirejourney.net/">Trial by Fire</a>, a local Journey tribute band, as their new keyboard player and backup vocalist. This was a legit band that played at places like <a href="http://www.amossouthend.com/">Amos' Southend</a> and <a href="http://fillmorecharlottenc.com/">The Fillmore</a> -- large local venues. I was really happy for him, dropped him a pound, and didn't think too much more of it. That was the spring of 2012 when I didn't have a whole lot going on...I was still recovering from my second shoulder surgery so all the athletic activities that used to take up a large part of my extracurricular time were now out of the question. Back in 2011 I bought an electronic drumset that would allow me to practice in my downtown Charlotte condo without annoying the piss out of my neighbors. I started to practicing regularly and more methodically. Having an electronic kit had the added benefit of being much more portable and allowed me to Â jam with other musicians much more easily. Later in 2012, Jason approached me about trying out for Trial by Fire as they were seeking a new drummer. I thought "what the hell", tried out and made it! I've never been a huge Journey fan per se, but I really started to appreciate their music a lot more as I started learning up on the songs. Also, I gained a new appreciation for musicians who perform live. There are many aspects of putting on a show (sound, lighting, equipment, transportation, stage presence) that I'd never properly considered before I was actually up there.</p>
<p>Flash forward to the present. I'm still a member of Trial by Fire, but I'm transitioning out of the band to move on to other ventures (more on that later). In the meantime, I'm playing with a more traditional cover band, <a title="Five on Sundays homepage" href="www.fiveonsundays.com">Five on Sundays</a>, that is just getting off the ground. This is another Jason Rome joint (do you sense a theme here?) that also features a number of other guys (Zak Foltz and Mark Miller) with whom I had previously jammed since moving to Charlotte. We've played two shows and we're looking forward to a few more in the next couple months.</p>
<p>The moral of this ramble? I don't know. I've been messing around with my various websites lately and felt like putting up some fresh content. So sue me.</p>
