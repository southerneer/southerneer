Fancy Rhino...

The last 20% was a bit gnarly though. While there were hooks built into Beaver Builder for writing custom modules, the documentation was slim at best and the actual process was tedious: write the code, clear the BB cache, check your changes, repeat. After a few hacks on my end I was able to iterate more quickly, but I'll be a bit more wary about throwing such a thick UI layer on top of future projects without more up-front research.


In short, this project was long. I think I initially estimated out about 6 weeks of work. More stuff cropped up than was expected, but even still it stretched out to over 4 months of most of my efforts devoted to this site. To be fair there was about a week of downtime when I drove cross-country to California and another couple weeks where I was more focused on the Brononymous Hotline, but even still this project ended up being a lot bigger than I had anticipated...and it was all my fault.

I'm pretty lazy when it comes to thinking through development projects. [Most developers are](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/648/how-to-respond-when-you-are-asked-for-an-estimate). We just want to jump in and start hacking. Also, I had done Wordpress work before, but never truly dug into the guts of writing my own theme, plugins, widgets, custom hooks, etc. I didn't know what I didn't know. It would have taken a couple weeks of learning more about the Wordpress development environment to even begin coming up with a reliable estimate. I was naive. Thankfully Drew and the rest of the Fancy peeps were patient and always willing to work with me. Hats off to them.
