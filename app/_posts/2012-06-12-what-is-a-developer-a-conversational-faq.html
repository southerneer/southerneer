<p>1. What is a software developer?</p>
<p>2. Oh, so you work with computers...great! I've been looking for someone to revive my 10-year-old malware-infested POS Dell. Can you help?</p>
<p>3. Ooh, so then you must be an expert with &lt;insert popular office productivity software product&gt;. Can you help me figure out something for work?</p>
<p>4. That has something to do with the interwebs, right? I'm writing a blog about all the fantastic variations of Justin Beiber's hairstyles. Can you show me how to add a flying toaster in the upper right-hand corner?</p>
