[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is my friend. But we have a complicated relationship. I know that we're better together than apart but sometimes gulp can just be so damn frustrating! A wiser man might say that I just need to take some time to understand it. I'm trying to be that wiser man.

Gulp is a web developer tool that I stumbled onto a couple years back when I got more serious about optimizing my workflow in the course of putting together web projects. Before that I had been using [Codekit](https://incident57.com/codekit/) mainly to handle auto-refreshes of a webpage as I developed in a code editor and saved. This alone was a huge time saver and I gradually started diving further into other Codekit features that would allow me to work more efficiently. I started getting into [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for generating CSS. I learned about integrating popular front-end frameworks with [Bower](http://bower.io/). At some point, though, I longed to learn more about what was going on behind-the-scenes.

Around this time I inherited a Wordpress project that used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to build and deploy the site. While I had heard of Grunt, I had never looked into it very much but my new project pretty much required that I dive right in. After some initial hair pulling I began to understand the power and flexibility in being able to write code to control file processing and auto refreshing that I had previously relied on Codekit to take care of. Don't get it twisted, Codekit is a great product that took care of 90% of my needs but as a "serious" developer I felt like it was important to go one level deeper to understand the build system.

As I worked more with Grunt I started to push up against its boundaries and limitations. Grunt is about [configuration over code](https://medium.com/@preslavrachev/gulp-vs-grunt-why-one-why-the-other-f5d3b398edc4#.ec2x5npwi) which is good for getting started quickly on small projects but tends to break down over time as your project grows in complexity. Accomplishing a task that doesn't already have a ready-made plugin can be a hassle. As I discovered with Gulp, there are fewer limitations on how you get something done...if there isn't already a plugin you just write the code yourself and hook it into the existing flow. That's not to say that Gulp is entirely unstructured either. Utilizing node concepts like streams and pipes you create modular pieces of middleware that are easily plugged into a project.

So I settled on Gulp as the ultimate developer tool to add to my toolbelt and started using it on all new projects. Different projects required different types of builds but for the most part I was repeating a lot of boilerplate Gulp tasks. Repetition is anathema to developers so I'm attempting to [DRY it up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).

My current stack for small (1-5 page) web projects that make up the bulk of my professional work:

* Front-end
    * ES6 & ES7 JS transpiled with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
    * [React JS](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
    * Bower (for front-end dependencies like jQuery, Bootstrap, etc)
    * Browserify (for client-side JS requires)
    * Sass -> CSS
    * Jade templates -> HTML
* Back-end
    * Node server running Express
    * MySQL (I know, shut up)
    * [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) for quick and dirty dev-side server
    * [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) for production node server
    * [rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) for deployment
