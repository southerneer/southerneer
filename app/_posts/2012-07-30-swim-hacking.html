<p>Since recovering from shoulder surgery I've been seeking out ways to stay active without running the risk of re-injuring myself. I started out running with the occasional 5k road race to keep the competitive juices flowing. The other day a couple of my friends convinced me to race the <a href="http://www.setupevents.com/?fuseaction=event_detail&amp;eventID=2002">Lake Norman YMCA Triathlon</a> with them. I've done one before, so I can probably do it again, no big deal...right?</p>
<p>Well, I'm a pretty terrible swimmer and I haven't swam more than one lap in 5 years. Even when I was training for the previous triathlon I never got completely comfortable with the psychology and timing of breathing on a schedule. Also, I neglected to prepare for one crucial difference of swimming in a race: open water swimming. Namely, open water swimming with lots of other dudes jostling and kicking you.</p>
<p>The race is less than a month away, but I'm determined to make a better showing of the swimming leg this go around. It's a sprint triathlon which "only" requires a 750 meter swim which equates to 15 laps (down and back) in my local gym's pool. Last week I joined JB and Whit (said friends) for my reintroduction to swimming and it was a rude one. I couldn't get more than 2 laps without succumbing to erratic breathing, loss of form, and general panic.</p>
<p>I needed a plan. Incidentally, I'd been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-4-Hour-Body-Incredible-Superhuman/dp/030746363X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1343617802&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=4+hour+body">The 4 Hour Body</a> and happened upon the chapter devoted to swimming. On the author's (Tim Ferriss) recommendation, I checked out a few videos from the Total Immersion swimming school.</p>

<p>Now I have something to shoot for in my own training. Videos of my first attempts at recreating the efficient TI freestyle stroke to follow...</p>
