<p>To be more clear, the login process on NBA League Pass sucks. Every time I come to the site I'm required to retype my user name to watch games. Even if I visit the page, log in, close the window, and visit one minute later it's as if I'd never visited that first time. This is strange. It's not as if I prevent cookie storage or javascript. And it's really easy for a site to store the user state either on the client side (with a cookie) or the server side so at least the site knows something about me when I visit again.</p>
