		<h2>Objective</h2>
		<p>
			I am a full-stack web developer by both preference (I like variety and learning new technologies) and necessity (I've worked as an independent developer for the last few years). I've concentrated more on front-end recently which is good for experience, but I'm seeking a role with a more challenging back-end environment. When considering a prospective employer I value <strong>working hard</strong> with <strong>smart people</strong> on a <strong>meaningful project</strong> above all else.
