    "Animation? Sure we can do webpage animation." We <em>almost</em> bit off more than we could chew with this project. The real challenge was the super tight timeline coupled with the need for lots of back-and-forth with the design team at Humanaut. Luckily the ScrollMagic scrolling animation Javascript library was just ready and waiting to save our butts. In just a couple days Southerneer was able to turn around a working demo of the animation functionality and in just a couple more churn out a game-ready and unique user experience for the client. Only Organic was really happy with the scroll-enabled animations and clean, mobile-friendly design.
