    Major props go to Humanaut for a great concept that we at Southerneer were happy to help bring to life. Organic Valley wanted a fun and interesting way to promote the launch of Organic Fuel and Humanaut delivered just the right balance of funny within the bounds of a wholesome brand.

    Here at Southerneer we were tasked with developing a one-page site that would feature the hilarious Save the Bros <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewBG_jmMI40'>Youtube video</a> and flesh out the details of the campaign as the user proceeded down the page. We started by priming visitors with a background video clip show coupled with a simple, bold call-to-action. Then peeking just above the fold is a extra content that cues users to scroll down and explore the rest of the page.

  <p>
    The Instafeed was really fun to put together. We used the existing simple but clever Instafeed.js library to pull in public Instagram photos labeled with bro-tastic hashtags like #yoked and #swole to make for an entertaining and interactive UX.

    Another fun challenge was making the site fully responsive and mobile-ready to max out sharing and viral potential. The mobile experience eliminated the hero background video (to save on mobile bandwidth) and just plugged in the Youtube video ready to be played by user choice. With the help of the ubiquitous and genius Bootstrap CSS and Javascript libraries we were able to put together a mobile-ready site that was modular enough to tweak on the fly with our design partners and ultimately deliver on a tight deadline.
